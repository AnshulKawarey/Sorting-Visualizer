# Sorting-Visualizer
Sorting Visualizer using matplotlib and numpy in python.

Currently it contains the following sorting algorithms:

  1.bubbleSort
  
  2.insertoinSort
  
  3.mergeSort
  
  4.quickSort
  

Prerequisites:

1.Python(https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2.matplotlib(https://matplotlib.org/stable/install/index.html)

3.numPy(https://numpy.org/install/)



About the sorting algorithms:

1.BubbleSort:

  In Bubble Sort algorithm,
  
  .traverse from left and compare adjacent elements and the higher one is placed at right side.
  
  .In this way, the largest element is moved to the rightmost end at first.
  
  .This process is then continued to find the second largest and place it and so on until the data is sorted.
  

2.InsertionSort:

  It works by iteratively inserting each element of an unsorted list into its correct position in a sorted portion of the list. 
  
  It is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning that elements with equal values maintain their relative order in the sorted output.
  

3.MergeSort:

  Merge sort is a sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer approach. 
  
  It works by recursively dividing the input array into smaller subarrays and sorting those subarrays then merging them back together to obtain the sorted array.
  
  In simple terms, we can say that the process of merge sort is to divide the array into two halves, sort each half, and then merge the sorted halves back together. 
  
  This process is repeated until the entire array is sorted.
  

4.QuickSort:

  QuickSort is a sorting algorithm based on the Divide and Conquer algorithm that picks an element as a pivot
  and partitions the given array around the picked pivot by placing the pivot in its correct position in the sorted array.
